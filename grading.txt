# Comments on your code
Good implementation of dummy_output_grads.
Clean prediction code.
Not necessary to keep batch_size tensor as input around.

# Comments on your write-up
Very good effort in trying new things and reading the papers.
Clearing context per sentence doesn't make sense to me, but clearing context per document does.
